RCEPROC-1252,"Engineering/Configuration",CE900 IO,"Error Indication: The PFQ module continues toaccumulate counts even though the HOLD input isenabled.Description: If a Pulse Input channel is first configuredwith the Frequency Input function and then reconfiguredto use the Pulse Input function, enabling the HOLDinput may not prevent the PFQ module fromincrementing the accumulated value and PV may notdrop to zero.Recovery: None.Workaround: Power cycle the PFQ module."
RCEPROC-1262,"Engineering/Configuration",CE900 IO,"Error Indication: Control Builder is crashing during""upload/update to project"" of CM containing AIREFblock.Description: If user do upload/update to projectoperation on a CM containing AIREF block withmonitoring side chart of that CM opened, then controlbuilder will crash.Recovery: None.Workaround:lIf the monitoring control module chart is opened,close it.lPerform an upload or update to the project."
RCEPROC-1264,"Engineering/Configuration",CE900 IO,"Error Indication: AVRAW and AV parameter values arenot simulated based on the simulated PV value.Description: If the AIREF block references the PIchannel of the PFQ module block, AVRAW and AVparameters can be projected on the AIREF block. If thesimulation is enabled on the AIREF block, the AVRAWand AV parameter values are updating from the PFQmodule block and not simulated based on simulated PVvalue. The AIREF block does not support the simulationof AVRAW and AV parameters.Recovery: None.Workaround: None."
RCEPROC-1273,"Engineering/Configuration",CE900 IO,"Error Indication: Writing Reset to the Pulse inputchannel from a push block with only STOREENB ONrunning at 50ms CM execution will make that channelas inoperable.Description: The pulse input channel will stopaccumulating the pulses when reset is pushed througha push block running at a 50ms CM execution period.Recovery: Delete the PFQ module and load it.Workaround: Enable STORONCHGENB to ON in thepush block, which is writing resetfl to the PFQ module."
RCEPROC-1265,"Engineering/Configuration",CE900 IO,"Error Indication: AIREF block PV value does not flow tothe DACA block.Description: If the AIREF block references the PIchannel of the PFQ module block and the channelfunction type is configured as Frequency Input, the PVvalue does not flow to the DACA block when simulationis enabled on the AIREF block.Recovery: None.Workaround:lOpen the Control Module from the project side.lOpen the AIREF block and remove the PI POINTreference and save the changes.lOpen the AIREF block again and assign the PIchannel reference which was referenced beforeand save the changes.lReload the CM from the project side."
RCEPROC-1271,"Engineering/Configuration",CE900 IO,"Error Indication: The download of the IO point withconfiguration changes causes the PV and rate of the PItotalizer block to reach high values.Description: The PI totalizer block configured with anAVRAW pulse input channel is going to a high valueduring the download of a PI point with configurationchanges.Recovery: Download PFQ module.Workaround: For configuration changes at the PI point,download the PFQ module, as the single-channeldownload is not supported for Pulse input channels."
RELCN-3970,System Stability,ELCN Bridge,"Error Indication: There is no clearindication of this error, which can bepresented in many ways, such as cableerrors, failure to transmit LCN packets.Description: ELCN Bridge LCNI needsexclusive access to shared memory and canbe corrupted.Recovery: ELCN Bridge needs to berestarted.Workaround: ELCN Bridge needs to berestarted."
1-FCJXEML,"OPM-Interoperability","cosmeticanomaly-CMW","Error Indication: [M&I] AI_LLAI module ver_rev entries are marked as Cx-PAIM51instead of CC-PAIL51.Description: The AI_LLAI module is referredas CCPAIL51 in R501.x, R510.x, R511.1/2,and R520 releases, etc., whereas in R511.3(+HFs), it is referred to as Cx-PAIM51.Recovery: None.Workaround: None."
1-FDI4PGP,Migration,UOC-SERIES-A,"Error Indication: The PROFIBUS data readby the ControlEdge UOC from thePROFIBUS SST card does not match thedata read from the PROFIBUS device.Description: SST - Series A Profibus issueobserved after C200 to UOC migrationcontaining Profibus SST Module,PROFIBUS SST card does not match thedata read from the PROFIBUS device.Recovery: None.Workaround: None."
1-FFC6HR9,System Stability,"3rdParty-EthernetIP","Error Indication: Momentarycommunication issue with Series A outputmodules under UOC where we have failedEIP/Profinet devices in the networkDescription: Chassis-based Series AModule Output is dropping for a momentduring UOC Switchover. This issue isobserved when we have failed EIP/ProfinetDLR Network.Recovery: Automatic.Workaround: None."
1-FJ6TSH7,Ace Cut Over,"CM-ConfigurationManagement","Error Indication: The ACE Ver_rev entry isnot updated, which causes the cutover tofail.Description: The Ver_rev entry for ACE hasrevision number 331 instead of revisionnumber 333.Recovery: None.Workaround: A Ver_rev 'true' entry changefor ACE would resolve the issue of cutover."
